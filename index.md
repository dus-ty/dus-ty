Blog. Frog. Fog.

  
I’m honestly not sure what I’ll be putting here yet, but I wanted a space to post the different projects I hope to start in the coming year. My goal is to keep it simple—no ads, no distractions, just the ideas I’m working on (no matter how uninteresting they might be). Simple was the plan...right after the hours of setup and fine-tuning to get things to this point.

Enjoy!
